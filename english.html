                <h2>What is a paella?</h2>
                <p> The origins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paella">paella</a> are ancient,they have their roots in the surroundings of Valencia (Spain), near the Albufera lagoon, where both fishing and rice cultivation dominated the region for centuries.
                     Paella was the food of farm workers who cooked rice dishes over wood fires, garnished with whatever ingredients they could find.
                     The dish is named after the wide, shallow pan in which the paella is cooked. The word "paella" comes from a Valencian dialect meaning "bread", probably derived from the Latin word "patella" for bread.

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>2 cups of rice <br>
                    4 cups of shrimp broth<br>
                    1/2 kg or squid<br>
                    1/2 kg of fresh prawns
                    1 handful of sea shells clams and mussels<br>
                    1 onion<br>
                    1 medium tomato<br>
                    1/2 red pepper<br>
                    2 cloves of garlic<br>
                    1/2 cup peas<br>
                    1 bunch of fresh parsley leaves<br>
                    Olive oil<br>
                    Salt<br>
                    Pepper<br>
                    Yellow food coloring or a few strands of saffron<br>

                <h2>Step-by-step preparation</h2>
                <p> Clean and peel the prawns. Use the shells and heads to make the broth. Reserve it.<br>
                     Also clean the squid and chop them into slices.<br>
                     Also clean the seashells with plenty of water to loosen any sand residue.<br>
                     In a paella pan or in a large skillet, sauté the onion, garlic, pepper and tomato chopped into small squares in olive oil. Add a little pepper and salt.<br>
                     Put the squid and then the sea shells. Let them cook for a few minutes until they become a broth<br>
                     Add the 2 cups of rice and stir to mix everything together. Then add 4 cups of the shrimp broth that you made earlier. If it is not enough for you, complete it with water.<br>
                     Stir well. Add a teaspoon of yellow food coloring or the saffron threads and boil for about 3 minutes.<br>
                     Even with liquid in the paellera, add the fresh peas, the prawns and the parsley previously chopped very small. Check for salt and pepper and add if necessary.<br>
                     Let cook until the liquid is almost dry. At this time you can put some strips of pepper to decorate and some prawns.<br>
                     Simmer covered.<br>
                     Let cook for about 15 minutes and taste the rice. If it is ready, remove from the heat and serve your seafood paella with a splash of olive oil on top to give it even more flavor.<br>

                <h2>Seafood paella: Some tips</h2>
                <p>The prawns must be fresh and have their skin and head, because you will need them to make one of the key ingredients of this seafood paella: the broth that you will use to cook the rice. This liquid is as important as the other ingredients.
                    The characteristic color of seafood paella is traditionally given by adding a few strands of saffron, if it is difficult to get it in your city, replace it with yellow dye.
                    The seafood to be used in the preparation of this dish may vary, it is not necessary that you use the ones that I indicate in this recipe. Depending on availability in your region, use one or the other. What I do recommend is that you do not stop adding prawns or prawns.
                    If you have a chance to put crab pieces on it, do it! The amount of flavor it gives is impressive, plus your seafood paella would look spectacular. If you use them, add them along with the squid and shells during cooking.
                    When serving it on the plate, some people add a splash of sherry and others lemon. The most recommended is olive oil.<br>
